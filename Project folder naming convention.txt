========
Naming convention for Bevy Rust projects:
n<index>_<projectType>_<type>_<name>

==
n<index>
Increment by 1 for each new project

rust projects cannot start with a number, so there is an "n" character before the index

==
<projectType>
One of the following:

bev
rus
mix

==
<type>
One of the following:

proto
real

==
<name>

write whatever you want here
use _ instead of spaces
