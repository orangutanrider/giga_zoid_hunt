Okay
Pointers are basically references?

Okay
it moves data
mmm
that is a bit fucked

Moving stuff
huh, man that is strange

Yeah shit man


Okay yeah
so you can take in a reference and own it
and then return that string and return ownership

==
Okay references now
I'm guessing that this is literally what pointers are

but yeh there are some obvious difficutlies that come with this

okay and you can use '&' to declare a reference

and you can have mutable references too

oh but you can only have one mutable reference to a particular piece of data, per scope
eh yeh that makes sense, i don't see why you'd need it to be otherwise

okay and you can't declare a heap object and return a reference of it in the same scope
yeah makes sense
(why wouldn't you just return the heap object)

okay and you can return a slice of a heap object
man
that is fucked

okay but you can return a slice of it
and it actually works with references

that is still a bit fucked but yeh it works
