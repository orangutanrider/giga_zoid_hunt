A minimal RTS game, built for my honours project, using Rust and Bevy. It was my introduction to Rust, Bevy, and ECS; Previous experience mostly lied in Unity and C#. The game features a complex enemy, that the design of was emergent.

The project's aim was to investigate the tools, with particular interest in architecture and maintainability. 

The deliverables of the project can be found in products.zip. Namely, a build, a personal-development-portfolio, and a tech report. Additionally, there are reports that were created throughout the project's development, notes, and documents that were required by the university. 

The source code is split among a number of Rust projects, most of them are small prototypes created for learning purposes. Of interest is N8, where the final build was built from.

## ART405 ART410
ART405 and ART410 were joint modules for the honours project, during my time at Abertay as an undergrad (2020-2024) (student number: 2002607). They spanned across the duration of year 4 (ART405 term 1, and ART410 term 2). Submissions were in May. Supervisors were allocated to students during ART410, my supervisor was Alexander Tarvet.

The official learning outcomes are as follows:
1. Manage and deliver a major research project that demonstrates critical engagement with their selected subject and that seeks to address self-selected research questions
2. Produce a body of work that evidences technical, creative, and professional skills in line with their identified discipline and future practice in the creative industries
3. Analyse and critically interpret their research and practice in the context of the subject domain and existing knowledge
4. Effectively communicate their critical engagement with the subject and the findings of their research
