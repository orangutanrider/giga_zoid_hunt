A minimal RTS game, built for my honours project, using Rust and Bevy. The project's aim was to investigate the tools, with particular interest in architecture and maintainability. There are a number of Rust projects contained in the repo, most of them are small prototypes created for learning purposes. The directory "n8_mix_real_workspace" is the main project directory, where the final build was compiled from.

You can play the game on [itch.io](https://orangou.itch.io/hunt-the-giga-zoid)
